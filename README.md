# Progress-Bar-Clicker
A simple clicker game where you are given a progress bar and a button to click on. You need to click the button to fill the progress bar. After the progress bar is filled, you receive a Progress Point. You can use the Progress Points to upgrade your clicker, Maximum Progress amount, fill speed, and more.
## Important Info
There are currently 2 versions in development; 
- A python app that hopefully will be available on steam, itch.io, and of course, here.
- A web version that will be playable on a website specially created for any web-games I create after I post this game.
